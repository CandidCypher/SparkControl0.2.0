SparkControl0.2.0
=================

This is the "branched" version of the Spark Control App that begins to separate components into discrete classes.

The purpose of this project is to serve as the primary GUI for the CoroBot Spark project. The goal of this is to provide
users graphical user interface that provides basic controls of the CoroBot Spark for basic education as well as interface a Python terminal. This will provide graphical information about sensor state, orientation of the bot, position of the camera, and ect. Will need to revisit the documentation in the future.
