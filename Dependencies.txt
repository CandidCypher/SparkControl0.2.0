This document is written for the purpose of listing all of the dependencies and
requirements to build a Spark SD Card image from source with the end goal of
creating a shell scrip that will automatically configure any Raspbian SD card
into a Spark compliant SD Card.

Build Process
1) Run software updates and upgrades
    -sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2) Build OpenCV
    -sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config libjpeg8-dev
    libtiff4-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev libgtk2.0-dev libdavcodec-dev
    libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran
    
    -wget https:bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
    -sudo python get-pip.py
    -sudo pip install virtualevn virtualenvwrapper #This is based upon Cameron
    Owens' best practicies phillosophy to allow for seperation of python
    projects
    

    -Something cool and interesting that needs to be commented.
